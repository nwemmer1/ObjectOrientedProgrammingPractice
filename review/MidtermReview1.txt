Object Oriented PRogramming
		Precondition - what must be satisfied for the function to run / requirements on input
		Postcondition - what must be returned 
			Write function with each
			
		Widening/narrowing contracts- every function has a contracts
			-explains what the function does and wat its purpose is
				-narrow contracts - functions with this called out of contract and that dont satisfy the precondition result in undefined behavior
				-wide contracts - they define behavior 
					-throw an exception
		contracts are made up of pre and post condition.
		if you tighten the precondition, you narrow the contract
			
			P-->Q ^ Q-/->P
		Are you allowed to replace a function
			more inputs given back means that there will be a stronger output
			strengthening by adding cases
			
		What does inheritance solve?
			represents alternatives
			
		Containers of polymorphic objects are simple(simple fast media library, drawable, transformable)
		Javascript goes into a script node
		
		webassembly- limited form of javascript that can be be used through your browser, efficient
		
		describe inheritance show code
			-base class and derived class
			
		discriminated union- big class with single member
			-another way to represent alternatives
			-solves the same type of inheritance issue	
		How do you know when to use DU over inheritance?
			-If you dont know all the derived classes later on
			-if you want lots of small copies of objects, you do not want to use inheritance hierarchies
			-doesnt copy very easily
			-garbage collection - doesnt delete anything (Java, C#)
		Public members inherited publicly are publicly
			-still public when you inherit its
			-private members inherited publicly are private to the base class, cant access them period
			-protected members inherited protected
			-static/dynamic typeif you declare a variable the static type of the variable is type declared
			-dynamic type of the object is whatever you call its
			-function takes JSON value as an argument the dynamic type of the value is a string,int,bool, etc. any of those things
		What are wedoing when we define a fcuntion virtual?
			-the definition is provided by the derived class
			-every overrirde in the function is in the derived class
		Piece-wise
			-every derived class is potentially a piece for the function
		What is the difference between virtual function and pure virtual function?
			-virtual function can be overwritten
			-pure virtual function must be overwritten
		Abstract class
			-at least one pure virtual function
