Object Oriented-Programming

What is abstraction?
	protection from lower level issues
	
How to represent a __ in a ___ ?

What is on the final?

	Abstraction
		What it means to build an abstraction
	OOP
		Surface level question
	Main language features
		Inheritance
			representation of alternatives
			restrict your domain
		Virtual functions
			piecewise definitions of functions
				print a JSON value
					"if x is bool" print true/false
					"if x is null" print null
						OVERRIDES
					(theoretically just a table)
			happens at run time, not compile time
			virtual vs. pure virtual
			virtual->else cause
			pure virtual->no else case
				classes are abstract
				cannot create an object of that case/type
	What are the main language features of generic programming?
		Templates
			What problems do templates solve?
				family of algorithms/types
				generates alternatives in oppose to representing them
				place-holder
				description of all of the algorithms/types
				What does this mean?
					We can provide different arguments at different times
				What are you solving by making a template?
					Multiple instances of the same code
						keep writing the same algorithm of different type
						eliminates redundancy
	****answer***		reduce code duplication
	
		Concepts
			What problems do concepts solve?
				Defines whats expected by a template
				"Almost like a base class in a hierarchy"
					in no way a base class
				in order to be a __type__ do A, B, and C...
				provide constraints on temporary arguments
				
			Do templates solve a design problem?
				It's an implementation problem
					Or is it a management problem?

			Do concepts solve a design problem?
				solve a language problem
		
	Polymorphism
		Dynamic
			Virtual functions
		What does it mean for a function to be dynamically polymorphism
			type is determined at run-time
		What does it mean for a function to be dynamically polymorphism
			type is determined at compile-time
		Why would you choose static over dynamic?
			When do you need that decision at run-time?
				choose dynamic only when you need the behavior to be determined at run-time
					Examples
						recursive data structure
						container whos type is determined at run-time
						memory allocation
	
	Substitution principles
		Liskov's substitution
			What is it and what is it's purpose?
				What does it tell you?
					If you can substitute one object of one type for another in some context, then the first is a sub-type of the second
						Applies normally to classes
							meant to talk about objects in OOP
								Square/Rectangle relation example
							Determined entirely on context
								When can you substitute one header file for another?
									No removal
									Additions are fine
									Change arguments?
										only if they have default arguments
									can I reorder members of a class?
										no
									can i add virtual functions to a class	
										depends where
											need to know how virtual tables work
										can append, but not change the order
									can i add new functions
										yes
									can i add new members to a class
										maybe
											may result in recompilation
		Used to measure whether or not a breaking change in the implementation and design
			measuring breakage
